"""Shared pytest fixtures: paths to the committed fixtures, and the no-network rule.

CI is offline by policy (roadmap/quality.md). The autouse fixture below makes
that a property of the suite rather than a promise: every socket connection
attempted by any test raises, so a test that reached for a data source would
fail here and in CI alike.
